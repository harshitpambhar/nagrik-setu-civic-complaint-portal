# Nagrik Setu – Civic Complaint Management Portal

## 📌 Overview
Nagrik Setu is a web-based civic complaint management portal designed to bridge the gap 
between citizens and local authorities. Many common civic issues such as garbage collection, 
street light failures, water leakage, stray animal problems, and noise pollution often go 
unreported or unresolved due to inefficient complaint systems.

Nagrik Setu provides a simple, user-friendly platform where citizens can register complaints, 
track their status, and improve transparency in civic issue resolution.
